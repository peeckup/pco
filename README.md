(Fork of https://github.com/kaspanet/kaspad)

## What is kobra

kobra is an attempt at a proof-of-work cryptocurrency with instant confirmations and sub-second block times. It is based on [the PHANTOM protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf), a generalization of Nakamoto consensus.

## Requirements

Go 1.18 or later.

## Installation

#### Build from Source

- Install Go according to the installation instructions here:
  http://golang.org/doc/install

```

- Run the following commands to obtain and install kobrad including all dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kobradag/kobrad
$ cd kobrad
$ go install . ./cmd/...

  not already add the bin directory to your system path during Go installation,
  you are encouraged to do so now.
